## What is Datapeer?

Datapeer is an analytics platform for understanding how users interact with your web applications. Track events, build funnels, create dashboards, and actually _understand_ what's happening in your product.

Your data stays in Datapeer. No third-party sharing, no surprises.

## Products

Datapeer (during the beta version) offers two products, each with its own documentation:

- Web Analytics: understand your traffic, pageviews, bounce rates, referrers, UTM attribution and Core web Vitals
- Product Analytics: understand your users, custom events, funnels, user identification, session tracking and behavioral insights. 

You can use one or both — they share the same SDK and dashboard, so there's no extra setup if you decide to add the other later.

## Quick start

### 1. Create your project

Sign up at [datapeer.io](https://datapeer.io), create your organization, and set up your first project. You'll get an API key — that's your golden ticket.

### 2. Install the SDK

Pick your platform and follow the guide:

| Platform                | Guide                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | [SDK Core →](/sdks/javascript) |
| React                   | [React SDK →](/sdks/react)     |
| Next.js                 | [Next.js SDK →](/sdks/nextjs)  |

### 3. See your data

Head over to the **Activity** page in your dashboard and watch the events roll in. If you don't see events right away, give it a few seconds — the SDK batches events before sending them. Patience is a virtue, and so is network efficiency.

## Core concepts

### Projects

A project represents a website or app you want to track. Each project gets its own API key and its own isolated data — so your marketing site and your main app don't step on each other's toes.

### Events

Events are the building blocks of your analytics. The SDK automatically captures standard events like `dp_pageview`, `dp_click`, and `dp_form_submit`. You can also track custom events with a single line of code.

Every event is automatically enriched with device info, session data, and attribution — no extra work on your end.

### Users & identity

Every visitor starts as anonymous. When they sign up or log in, you link their activity to a real user ID. Their full journey — before and after signup — stitched together in one timeline.

### Sessions

A session starts when a user lands on your site and expires after 30 minutes of inactivity. Tracked automatically. You don't need to manage them yourself.

### Insights & Dashboards

Create **trends** to see how events change over time. Build **funnels** to find where users drop off. Pin your favorites to **dashboards** and share them with your team — because "I think signups are up" is not a data strategy.
